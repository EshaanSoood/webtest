          <strong>Dear Listener,</strong><br><br>
          Nothing warms my heart more than knowing that even in the year 2025 you decided to get this
          CD. This album, Dream River, is one that has been in the making for 6 years. All the river's twists
          and turns have resulted in this music. Each song on this album is a short story from diﬀerent
          phases of my life. From the very first jazz song I wrote, Mountain Muse, to the latest Sailing
          Through Dream River, I hope as you listen to this album you are taken on a ride. A Journey
          through all the beautiful and not so beautiful moments in life - yours, mine, all of ours, captured
          and turned into a sonic concoction for you to send your memories sailing like paper boats. The
          reason this album took so long to make can be distilled to one word - belief. As the currents of the
          river took me diﬀerent places, my self-belief felt like waves, rising high before they crashed on a
          shore. It took all of this time to realise that these waves are the very energy that gives the water
          movement. I hope this discovery, the joy and happiness in riding the ups and downs of life
          brings some light and joy to your own river.<br><br>
          Much Love,<br>
          Eshaan
        </p>
