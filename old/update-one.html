                      <h4>Hello!</h4>
                      <p>Eshaan writing in with a happy new update. We were initially planning to send out the first update some time in April with some rehearsal footage and some clips from a show we are playing on the 26th. However, we crossed 20% of our goal and I thought that should be celebrated.</p>
                      <p> So here are the things we are going to cover in this update -</p>
                      <ol role="list">
                        <li>Our First Hiccup - Our Pianist - Annie, almost had to drop out.</li>
                        <li>We won a grant.</li>
                        <li>A special early version of a song and it’s story.</li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>‍</p>
                      <h5>So Number 1 - Annie got a big tour opportunity.</h5>
                      <p>My friend Annie Orzen who plays piano in the band. and also writes out all the sheet music joined the group right when we weren&#x27;t even playing all original music. Jazz is a weird genre where there aren&#x27;t many bands and people usually hire who ever is available and can do justice to the music. I&#x27;ve always looked at the group as a band however and while I am in a certain place, Rochester right now, I try my best to play with the same people every time. Like I said Annie had been a core part of the group since the beginning of it&#x27;s Rochester chapter and over the last 2 years the sound of the group has really shaped itself with her being on the piano bench. So she got offered a nice chunky tour and I don&#x27;t know if I am allowed to say much more at the moment so I won&#x27;t but needless to say, all of us dream of getting such opportunities. The catch was however that our studio date was right in the middle of this tour. Luckily, by some stroke of black magic and luck we were able to reschedule the date keeping the entire personnel intact for May 11th and 12th. So all&#x27;s well that ends well.</p>
                      <p>‍</p>
                      <h5>IML Mentorship Grant.</h5>
                      <p>We won a grant that will cover the performance fees for some of the musicians in the band. This is a 750 dollar grant awarded to 5 people every 6 months and I am happy to announce that this project got selected as one of the winners this year. This grant is provided by the institute of Music Leadership at the Eastman School Of Music and it is quite delightful to have their support for this project.</p>
                      <p>‍</p>
                      <h5>And last but not the least - If Our hearts Could Talk.</h5>
                      <p>The recording in the attachment is a audio version played live recently. You might notice that there is no saxophone in the recording. This is because this is from my graduation recital and there was a pointless requirement for me to be the primary feature on every song. In a way it is cool because this means the final studio version will be drastically different. I wrote this song because often times we read in between the lines of what people say too much. I think for most people if we just functioned under the assumption that people do not mean us harm or ill small day to day things wouldn&#x27;t really bother us as much and the world would be a little more chilled out. The song starts with a gentle melody played on the bass and gradually builds up in intensity. After the initial two sections you will hear a beautiful piano solo by Annie, it honestly has some of my favourite phrases ever. After her solo, we have an interlude which represents a different point of view and the whole feel of the band changes for a second. However, the guitar goes back and improvises over the same section that the piano did, trying to represent the fact that if we don&#x27;t think super hard we&#x27;d be on the same page more often. The song ends with some recap from an old section delivered first with gusto and then gently and then a simple melody to close things off, trying to take the idea that every interaction doesn&#x27;t have to have many layers even when it may seem like it.</p>
